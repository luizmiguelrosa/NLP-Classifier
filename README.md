<h1 align="center">NLP Classifier</h1>
This project represents my personal initiative to delve into the world of Natural Language Processing (NLP). As part of my journey, I aim to progressively implement more sophisticated classification techniques in due course. However, for the current phase, I have opted to adhere to basic logic.

To ensure seamless utilization of the library, I have thoughtfully prepared comprehensive [documentation](https://github.com/Masso13/NLP-Classifier/wiki) outlining the necessary steps to be followed.

### Requirements:
* [Python 3.10.4](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3104/)
